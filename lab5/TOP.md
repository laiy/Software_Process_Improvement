### My Thinking On TOP(Thinking Oriented Programming)

## What Is TOP

1. It is a programming style.
2. It strongly relies on high encapsulated along with intergrated tools.
3. Its core programming method is divde and conquer, what is special is that the language and tool is so strong that the code is strongly readable and easily understandable, therefore, programmer could code more fluently and focus on what he is thinking.

## My Practic On TOP

* Sincerely, I have follow divide and conquer programming method for a long time, and I was familiar with the tool required. In fact, I did not find any difference at first, Nevertheless, when I thought lately, I found the core, that is, It is not a programming method like divide and conquer or code from bottom to top but is a programming style affecting on the programming process, which reflect on that, for instance, I meet a problem, I divide it into several sub issues, the affection on this programming process is that I could conquer the issues very easily, and as a result, I could focus on thinking fluently. 

* As for me, when a programmer was coding with a scientific method with efficient tool, he is doing TOP though he even did not know this concept.
